# Scoreboard
A simple scoring system for a quiz I did.

This features a main menu that allows you to enter all the team names
A separate scoring tab will be created for each team

Each scoring tab features a cash builder section that goes 0 -> 100 -> 250 -> 500 -> 750 -> 1000
On a win, you move up a stage in the cash builder
On a loss, you reset to 0
On a bank, the money you've built is saved and the cash builder resets to 0
